# Multilingual-TTS-with-Translation-using-gTTS
A simple multilingual text-to-speech project using Python's `gTTS` for speech synthesis and `deep-translator` for translation. This script takes an English sentence, translates it into multiple languages, generates speech files with a professional 800ms silent lead-in, and plays the audio inline (suitable for Google Colab).
